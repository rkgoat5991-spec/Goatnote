It's for artists who believe in community over corporate nonsense.</p>

                <h3>How do royalties work?</h3>
                <p>Through our distribution partner, LabelLift, you receive 90% of your royalties directly. The remaining 10% is a small royalty cut that helps us cover our basic operating costs and grow the label to support more artists. We are a non-profit label, and this cut is the bare minimum to keep us going.</p>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>Do you own my music if I release with you?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. You retain 100% of the rights to your music. We are simply a distribution channel to help you reach a wider audience. Your songs, your art, your ownership—always.</p>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>What genres do you accept?</h3>
                <p>All of them! We love music that is made with heart, no matter the genre. From lo-fi beats and hip-hop to rock, electronic, and experimental music, if you made it with love, we want to hear it.</p>
