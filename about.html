            <h1>About Goatnote</h1>
            <p>Goatnote is a small, independent music label and music distributor started by a teenage artist who just wanted to release music without all the industry nonsense. It began as a personal project, but quickly turned into something bigger—a space for other independent artists who just want to make and share their music freely.</p>
            <p>At Goatnote, there are no contracts, no middlemen taking control—just artists supporting artists. Whether you're making lofi beats, ambient tracks, or weird experimental stuff that doesn’t fit anywhere else, this label is here for you. Right now, it’s just me running everything—distribution, emails, cover art, all of it. We use LabelLift to get your music out there, which means you keep 90% of your royalties. The 10% royalty cut helps us function and keep this growing to empower more artists.</p>
            <p>Goatnote isn’t about huge profits. It’s about building a community where your sound stays yours. If you’ve ever felt like your music didn’t have a place, maybe this is it.</p>
