            <h2>Goatnote – Terms & Conditions (kinda)</h2>
            <p>Last updated: June 2025</p>
            <p>Hey. So if you’re thinking of releasing music through Goatnote, here’s all the important stuff you should know. No legal mumbo jumbo here — just plain talk from a fellow artist who started this thing from scratch.</p>

            <h3>1. You Own Your Music</h3>
            <p>First off: whatever you make — it’s yours. 100%. Goatnote doesn’t own your songs, beats, lyrics, cover art, nothing. I’m just here to help you release it properly and maybe get a few more people to hear it. We use LabelLift to distribute your music, which means you keep 90% of your royalties. The 10% royalty cut helps us function and keep this growing. This label is about vibes, not huge profits.</p>

            <h3>2. No AI Music. Like, Seriously.</h3>
            <p>We don’t accept music made completely by AI. No ChatGPT-generated lyrics, no AI music generators, no robots pretending to feel things. Goatnote is about real emotion, even if it's messy or imperfect. Music made by people >>> music made by code.</p>
            <p>Using tools like AI mastering or FX plugins is cool — as long as the core music is your own human creation.</p>

            <h3>3. Make Sure It’s Yours</h3>
            <p>Only send tracks that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You actually made</li>
                <li>Don’t steal samples or loops you don’t have permission for</li>
                <li>Aren’t copied from other artists or websites</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s keep this label clean and honest. If you used a sample, make sure it’s either royalty-free or cleared.</p>

            <h3>4. How It Works</h3>
            <p>You can release through Goatnote in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use your own distributor account, and just set Goatnote as the label name</li>
                <li>Send me the track, details, and cover art, and I’ll handle the upload</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Either way, you’re chillin’. Your release will also be posted on Goatnote’s socials and added to our official playlists (sorted by genre so your chill beat doesn’t get dumped between EDM and death metal).</p>

            <h3>5. All Genres Welcome</h3>
            <p>Goatnote does not care what genre you make. Lofi? Fire. Rock? Go off. Ambient frog synthcore? Honestly, kinda cool. If you made it with love, we’re down.</p>

            <h3>6. We Might Say No (But Nicely)</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, we might decline a submission. Not to be mean — just to keep the vibe right. We’ll say no if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The song breaks the AI rule</li>
                <li>The content is offensive or hateful</li>
                <li>The track feels super rushed or clearly just made to spam streams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We want Goatnote’s catalog to feel real. That’s all.</p>

            <h3>7. I Actually Reply Fast</h3>
            <p>This label’s run by just me. A 16-year-old artist. So yeah, I’ll actually respond to your DMs or emails within a few hours (unless I’m asleep or stuck in school). No “we’ll get back to you in 7-10 business days” type of thing.</p>

            <h3>8. No Fees. Just Music.</h3>
            <p>There's no sign-up fee. It’s just something I started to help artists like me — the ones doing everything on their own. The 10% royalty cut is the bare minimum we need to keep this growing and empower more artists. In the future, we might offer optional upgrades, but the main label will always be free to join.</p>

            <h3>9. The Vibe Matters</h3>
            <p>This label runs on trust, creativity, and good energy. These terms aren’t here to scare anyone — they’re just here to make sure we’re all on the same page. If you're here to make music that means something, welcome to Goatnote. Let’s make some noise – rkgoat, Founder of Goatnote.</p>
